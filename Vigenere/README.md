# Vigenère Cipher - En/Decoder
A small program for encrypting and decrypting with the Vigenère Cipher, assuming you know the key. A Windows executable can be found in the dist directory. Note that some antiviruses might detect the program as a Trojan. The program is perfectly safe, so feel free to add it as an exception to the threat detection. The code can be found in the src directory. The vigenere.py file was used to create an executable using the pyinstaller package.
